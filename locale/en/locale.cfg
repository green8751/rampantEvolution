[mod-setting-description]
rampant-evolution--evolutionPerWormKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by worms being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerUnitKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by biter units being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerHiveKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by Rampant hives being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerSpawnerKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by spawners being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTileAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by tiles. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTreeDied=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution damaging trees. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTreeAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by trees. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerSpawnerAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by spawners. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution--evolutionPerPollution=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being generated. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution--evolutionPerTime=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by time elapsed in seconds. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution--recalculateAllEvolution=When this setting is checked the evolution will be recalculated from the beginning of the game when mod settings change. This will not be a perfect reconstruction of the past evolution.
rampant-evolution--displayEvolutionMsgInterval=This is the interval that the evolution will be displayed on the console or in the gui. /rampantEvolution in the console will display the stats on-demand.
rampant-evolution--displayEvolutionMsg=This is the setting to enable evolution to be displayed on the console at the specified interval. /rampantEvolution in the console will display the stats on-demand.
rampant-evolution--setMapSettingsToZero=If you have an existing save that you want to use this mod on and you want to pause the original map evolution settings. THIS IS PERMANENT, IF YOU REMOVE THE MOD WITH THIS SETTING CHECKED THE EVOLUTION WILL STAY PAUSED. UNCHECKING SHOULD RE-ENABLE THE VANILLA EVOLUTION.
rampant-evolution--minimumDevolutionPercentage=Everytime the evolution goes up, this percentage is multiplied by evolution and stored as the lowest value the evolution can reach. So if you set the mod setting to 0.25 and your evolution hits 10% the lowest your evolution can go to is 2.5%
rampant-evolution--evolutionResolutionLevel=The number of delta counts to compute at a single point. The higher the number the worse the accuracy for recalculating evolution. The tradeoff is low numbers will take a long time to finish recalculating. When this number is 0 it will be auto calcaluted based on the number of ticks in the game. On auto mode, accuracy starts at 20 and moves to 4000 based on x where x is game.ticks / (80 hrs). At 4000, an 80 hour game will take ~15 minutes to recalculate.
rampant-evolution--shortcut-bar=Display evolution stats gui

rampant-evolution--refreshingEvolution=RampantEvolution: Recalculating evolution, this could take several minutes to recalculate. Script times will be higher while reprocessing.
