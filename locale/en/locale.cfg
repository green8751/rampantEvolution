[mod-setting-description]
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerUnitKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by biter units being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerHiveKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by Rampant hives being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerSpawnerKilled=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by spawners being killed. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTileAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by tiles. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTreeDied=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution damaging trees. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerTreeAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by trees. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution-evolutionPerSpawnerAbsorbed=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being absorbed by spawners. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution--evolutionPerPollution=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by pollution being generated. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution--evolutionPerTime=This setting changes how evolution should be affected by time elapsed in seconds. This number should be treated the same as the vanilla pollution, spawner, and time sliders in terms of how to interpret it
rampant-evolution--recalculateAllEvolution=When this setting is checked the evolution will be recalculated from the beginning of the game when mod settings change. This will not be a perfect reconstruction of the past evolution.
rampant-evolution--displayEvolutionMsgInterval=This is the interval that the evolution will be displayed on the console.
rampant-evolution--displayEvolutionMsg=This is the setting to enable evolution to be displayed on the console at the specified interval.
rampant-evolution--setMapSettingsToZero=If you have an existing save that you want to use this mod on and you want to disable the original map evolution settings. THIS IS PERMANENT, IF YOU REMOVE THE MOD WITH THIS SETTING CHECKED THE EVOLUTION WILL STAY DISABLED. UNCHECKING SHOULD RE-ENABLE THE VANILLA EVOLUTION.

rampant-evolution--refreshingEvolution=RampantEvolution: Recalculating evolution, this could take several minutes to recalculate. Script times will be higher while reprocessing.
